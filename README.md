## My Contribution to PantryNode:

### Highlights:

1. I collaborated with w/decoles on the Summary Page. Our tasks were divided: David focused on creating tables, while I worked on designing and developing charts. I conceptualized the overall design and implemented a toggle feature, allowing users to switch between viewing the charts and tables. Additionally, I incorporated various design changes to the tables based on feedback from our code reviewers.
